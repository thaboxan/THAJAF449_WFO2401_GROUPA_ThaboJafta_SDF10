## Learning Journey

Building this website helped me learn and understand several key concepts:

- **Tailwind CSS**: I learned how to use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. This project helped me understand how to use utility classes to style my website.
- **Flexbox**: I gained a deeper understanding of Flexbox, a CSS layout module that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures. I used Flexbox to build the navigation bar and other components of the website.
- **CSS Grid**: I learned how to use CSS Grid, a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that is a powerful tool for creating complex responsive designs. I used CSS Grid to create the layout for several sections of the website.

## Challenges Encountered

While building this website, I encountered several challenges:

- **Understanding Tailwind CSS**: As a utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS was initially challenging to grasp. However, with practice, I was able to understand how to use utility classes to style my website effectively.
- **Implementing Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looked good on both desktop and mobile devices was a challenge. I learned how to use media queries and responsive design classes in Tailwind CSS to achieve this.
- **Creating a Navigation Bar**: Making the navigation bar at the top of the page required a good understanding of CSS positioning. I learned how to use several classes in Tailwind CSS to achieve this.
- **Using CSS Grid**: Creating complex responsive designs using CSS Grid was challenging. However, with practice, I was able to understand how to use CSS Grid effectively.
